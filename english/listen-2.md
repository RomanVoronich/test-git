# It is a long story

## Part 2

Judy is worried. 

She doesn't know where Sam is.

The bank manager doesn't know where Sam is, either.

He is very worried.

Sam is in Brazil, in a small town on the coast near Rio de Janeiro, with Â£50,000 of the bank's money.

He is sitting in a bar near the beach, drinking a large martini and writing a letter to Judy.



```
        Rio, Tuesday.
        Darling Judy,


Well, here I am in Brazil. 
It's very warm here and the sea is nice for swimming.
The women here are very beautiful and very, very friendly.
But I miss you, Judy. Please, come and stay with me in Brazil.
Can you take the 13.25 flight from London to Rio on April 14?
I'll meet you at the airport.
        All my love.
        Sam.
